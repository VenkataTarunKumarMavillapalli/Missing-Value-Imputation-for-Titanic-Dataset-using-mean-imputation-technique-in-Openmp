# Missing-Value-Imputation-for-Titanic-Dataset-using-mean-imputation-technique-in-Openmp
Missing value imputation for titanic dataset using mean imputation technique in Openmp and plotted a graph for execution time Vs number of threads.
It is a Final Group Project, for Data Management & Comuputer Networks. We have used The UNINA cluster(University): 32 nodes, 128 GPUs.
Accessing the cluster: the user interface. Programming with MPI and Open MPI. Programming in CUDA.
We have submitted our work to LECTURER: Prof. Guido Russo which got a great Result.
